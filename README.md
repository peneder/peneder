# Hi, I'm Peter 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a machine learning researcher and bioinformatician specializing in deep learning for precision medicine. I build multimodal ML models for complex biomedical data. I recently completed my PhD at the University of Vienna and the Tomazou lab, St. Anna Children’s Cancer Research Institute in Vienna, Austria.

## 🔥 Notable Projects

- **DEFT** (availabale soon)
  A multimodal, epigenetics-based deep learning model for enhanced detection of circulating tumor DNA in liquid biopsies. (Developed by me)
  
- **[CellWhisperer](https://cellwhisperer.bocklab.org/)**  
  A multimodal AI model that bridges transcriptomics data and natural language, enabling intuitive interaction with scRNA-seq datasets. (Developed together with [Moritz Schäfer](https://github.com/moritzschaefer))
  
- **[LIQUORICE](https://liquorice.readthedocs.io/)**  
  A user-friendly tool for inferring epigenetic signatures from cell-free DNA. (Developed by me)
