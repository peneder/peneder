# Hi, I'm Peter 👋

I'm a machine learning researcher and bioinformatician specializing in AI x Bio for biosecurity. In the past, I've built multimodal machine learning / deep lerarning models for complex biomedical data. I recently completed my PhD at the [University of Vienna](https://univie.ac.at/en)  and the [Tomazou lab](https://tomazoulab.org/) at the [St. Anna Children’s Cancer Research Institute](https://ccri.at/)   in Vienna, Austria.

## 🔥 Notable Projects

- **DEFT**  
  A multimodal, epigenetics-based deep learning model for enhanced detection of circulating tumor DNA in liquid biopsies - available soon! (Developed by me)
  
- **[CellWhisperer](https://cellwhisperer.bocklab.org/)**  
  A multimodal AI model that enables intuitive, language-based exploration of single-cell transcriptomics data (Developed together with [Moritz Schäfer](https://github.com/moritzschaefer))
  
- **[LIQUORICE](https://liquorice.readthedocs.io/)**  
  A user-friendly tool for inferring epigenetic signatures from cell-free DNA. (Developed by me)
